Step to installing the driver:

1 - Compilation
	
	1.1 - 	In order to compile our stuff for BBB..
		First we need to export ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE manually 
		export ARCH=arm
		export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

	1.2 -	We need to compile our dts, to do that we rename our old 
		.dts file with to am335x-boneblack-uboot-univ-old.dts, 
		and we put the new one on it's place (~/<path_to_linux_sources>/arch/arm/boot/dts/)

		(The other way is to add a rule to compile your custom dts in the Makefile, and you wont have to rename the old 
		one and add new one with the same name I didn't do it this way so I might be wrong)		

		To compile - "make dtbs"
		And the generated am335x-boneblack-uboot-univ.dtb is what we are gonna use.
		Located again in ~<path_to_linux_sources>/arch/arm/boot/dts/

	1.3 -	Compiling the driver is pretty much the same, 
		just exporting ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE (explained above).
		After that just run the Makefile for your ext driver and you are gonna get a .ko generated
	
	1.4 - 	In case the kernel version that you are compiling against is different you can change 
		the kernel version on the board by simply replacing the zImage that is on board (That is what I did)

		"make zImage" - will generate you zImage located in ~/<path_to_linux_sources>/arch/arm/boot/
		The kernel image that is being loaded while booting the board is located in "/boot/" (on board)

2 - Changing the old stuff with the new compiled stuff

	
	2.1 - 	Basically what is left to do is to change the old .dtb file located in "/boot/dtbs/<version>" with the new .dtb file 
	that we just compiled doing the steps above. To upload it I used SD card and SD card reader, since I was using the SD card 
	instead of the on board eMMC. 

	(Like explained in 1.2 in case we compiled our own .dts with custom name we need to add 
	rule while booting to be loaded that specific .dtb, I didn't do it this way so I might be wrong)

	2.2 - 	Then change the kernel image aswell (if needed), the onboard kernel image is located in "/boot/<kernimage>"

	2.3 - 	After that just "sudo insmod <driver_name>.ko" and sudo cat /dev/<device_name> to read the temperature
